# 🩺 Diabetes Mellitus Prediction using Machine Learning in R

A machine learning project that predicts the onset of diabetes using supervised learning algorithms implemented in **R**. The project compares Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to identify the most effective classifier for diabetes prediction.

## 📌 Project Overview

Early diagnosis of diabetes plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare risks. This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

The implementation focuses on comparing two supervised learning algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree

The models are evaluated using standard classification metrics to determine their predictive performance.


## 📂 Dataset

The project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains medical information collected from female patients.

The dataset includes attributes such as:

- Number of Pregnancies
- Plasma Glucose Concentration
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Serum Insulin
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

Target Variable:

- Diabetes Outcome (Positive / Negative)


## ⚙️ Methodology

The workflow includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Train-test split (70:30)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classification
- Model comparison


## 📊 Model Evaluation

Performance is evaluated using:

- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy
- Sensitivity
- Specificity
- Precision
- Recall

The project compares both models based on predictive accuracy.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- R
- caret
- tree
- e1071
- ggplot2
